// KeyboardContext is provided here, above everything, so any component can
// read it via useContext regardless of where in the tree it sits — notably
// app/layout.tsx's useLayerToggle calls, which listen for keys *before*
// they render the nested LayerHost that would otherwise be the nearest
// provider (context only flows to descendants, so a component can't read a
// provider it renders itself).
