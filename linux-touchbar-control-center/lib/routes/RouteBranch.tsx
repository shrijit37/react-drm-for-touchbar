/**
 * Renders one app/ route segment: its own layout.tsx (if any) wrapping a
 * LayerHost switching between its children, where each branch child (a
 * folder with its own layout.tsx) recurses into another RouteBranch instead
 * of being rendered as a plain leaf component. Keyboard access comes from
 * KeyboardContext (provided once at the true root in App.tsx) rather than a
 * prop threaded through every level — LayerHost already falls back to it.
 * This branch's own nested host is registered into router-registry.ts under
 * its path, so anything anywhere can drive it via go(path) — a layout.tsx
 * never needs its own ref/prop/context plumbing to reach it.
