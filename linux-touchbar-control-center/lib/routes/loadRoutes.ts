// via LayerHost's own index-0 fallback — no separate "initial" config needed.

// mounted while its children switch. RouteBranch (lib/routes/RouteBranch.tsx)
// is what actually wires a folder's layout to its children at render time —
// this module only does fs/import mechanics. Key-gesture bindings (Fn key,
// dock shortcut, ...) are NOT part of this — they're not a routing concern,
// see lib/hooks/useLayerToggle.ts, called directly wherever a binding
// belongs, driven through router-registry.ts.
